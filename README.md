# Untitled OS

Untitled OS is an x86_64 operating system written from scratch in C. This project is still in progress and is intended for educational purposes.

## A Brief Overview

Untitled OS started as a passion project and remains a work in progress. It is designed for learning and experimentation rather than practical use, as it is far from complete or stable.

## Compiling the Source

To compile the source code, execute the `make` command in the parent directory:
```
make
```
This will generate an ISO file and start QEMU. You may need to update the compiler path and other settings in the Makefile to suit your environment.
