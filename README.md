# Untitled OS

Untitled OS is an x86_64 operating system written from scratch in C, and is still in progress.

<br>

To have a look at the system, simply execute the make in the parent directory:
```
make
```

<br>

Before, executing the make command, make sure you have `gcc`, `mtools` and `grub` available on your system. The make command will try to launch the generated iso on `QEMU`, but you can use any virtual machine manager for it.
